# Adventure

Welcome to Adventure!

This half finished project was inspired by my high school Computer Science teacher Mr. Hampton.  The code here builds two squads and does this through the use of classes and many functions.  The code also creates a GUI using a module/library called tkinter.  This opens a window with a text output as well as buttons that effect each squad or output useful information.  While this code is not finished it has the groudwork for something absolutely amazing.
