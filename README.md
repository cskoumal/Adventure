# Adventure

Welcome to Adventure!

This half finished project was inspired by my high school Computer Science teacher Mr. Hampton.  The code here builds two squads and does this through the use of classes and many functions.  The code also creates a GUI using a module/library called tkinter.  This opens a window with a text output as well as buttons that effect each squad or output useful information.  While this code is not finished it has the groudwork for something absolutely amazing.

This program is named 'Adventure' and it gives you control of a squad of characters with random names and statistics. You will be able to battle with this squad against another squad. While I have spent a great deal of time with the program it is still not in a complete state. A GUI is present but much of the game loop is unplayable and only some basic concept and functions are useable. Right now the program creates two squads for you and an opponent. You are able to attack using only the first members of each squad. The health and damage for each member of a squad is randomized in a range determined by their class. You can also heal yourself but only 5 times to limit the health possible. I started to write my main loop for the program but I unfortunately ran out of time. One of the final features include the ability for the first memeber of your squad to speak. The final feature though allows you to view either your or your opponents squad stats.

Future Features List:

- Full Functioning Combat Loop: I want to make the battle fully functional.
- More Detailed GUI
- Dead Character Removal
- Character Switching
- Individual Character Naming
- Unique Class Skills/Attributes
- Fully Commented/Organized Code
- Replayability
